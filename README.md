UPDATE 12 August, 2013
=============

Raspberry Pi and other arm platforms are now supported natively in openFrameworks!
----

This repository and associated wiki will be kept unil the openFrameworks 0.9.0 release and will then be deleted.

All users are encouraged to visit the openFrameworks Download page to get the latest release!

http://www.openframeworks.cc/download/

Please use the new setup guide rather than the wiki attached to this repository:

http://www.openframeworks.cc/setup/raspberrypi/

Existing issues in this repository will be migrating to the main openFramworks issues page in the coming days / weeks.

Thanks to all who made this possible, particularly @jvcleave @danthemellowman @arturoc @bakercp and everyone who posted issues and helped test!
